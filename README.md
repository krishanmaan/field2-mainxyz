This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Features

### Map Features
- **Field Drawing**: Draw polygons to represent fields with area and perimeter calculations
- **Distance Measurement**: Measure distances between points on the map
- **Custom Markers**: Add, edit, and customize markers with labels and colors
- **Save & Load**: Automatically save your work to the cloud or local storage

### Marker Functionality
The application includes a full-featured marker system that allows you to:
- Add markers anywhere on the map
- Customize marker labels
- Change marker colors
- Drag and reposition markers
- Undo/redo marker actions
- Markers are automatically saved to localStorage and persist between sessions

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
